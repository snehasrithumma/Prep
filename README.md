## Core Services

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Identity Management Systems: Systems like Active Directory that manage user identities and control access to resources.
   - Single Sign-On (SSO): A service that allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple systems without being prompted to log in again.
2. **Database Services:**
   - Relational Databases: Such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
   - NoSQL Databases: Such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.
3. **Application Hosting and Deployment:**
   - Web Servers: Such as Apache and Nginx.
   - Application Servers: Such as Tomcat, JBoss, and WebSphere.
   - Container Orchestration: Tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm that manage containerized applications.
4. **Monitoring and Management:**
   - System Monitoring: Tools like Nagios, Zabbix, and Prometheus that monitor system performance and alert administrators to issues.
   - Log Management: Systems like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) that aggregate and analyze log data.
5. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Backup Solutions: Systems that regularly copy data to secondary locations for safekeeping.
   - Disaster Recovery: Plans and systems to restore data and systems in case of a catastrophic failure.
6. **Security Services:**
   - Firewalls: Devices or software that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
   - Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Tools that monitor network or system activities for malicious activities.
   - Encryption Services: Systems that protect data by converting it into a secure format.
7. **Communication and Collaboration:**
   - Email Services: Such as Microsoft Exchange or Gmail for Business.
   - Collaboration Tools: Such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom.
