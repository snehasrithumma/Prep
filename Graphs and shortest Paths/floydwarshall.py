# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
# Purpose:
# Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph 
# (including both positive and negative weights, but no negative weight cycles).

# Comparison and Use Cases
    # Dijkstra's Algorithm:
        # Best for finding the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes.
        # Efficient with priority queues.
        # Only works with non-negative weights.
    # Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:
        # Best for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
        # Handles both positive and negative weights.
        # Simpler to implement but less efficient for large graphs due to ùëÇ(ùëâ**3) complexity
