# According to Oxford Languages, a Facade is

# an outward appearance that is maintained to conceal a less pleasant or creditable reality.
# In the programming world, the "outward appearance" is the class or interface we interact with as programmers. And the "less pleasant reality" is the complexity that is hidden from us.
# So a Facade, is simply a wrapper class that can be used to abstract lower-level details that we don't want to worry about.
